Character Level CNN using Tensorflow 1.15

Google Colab notebook for classifying text.

Can be trained classify any string of characters, e.g. human text or a DNA sequence. All it needs is a labeled training set.

Converts a text to a sequence of one-hot character encodings, and learns to predict text class using a sequence of convolutional layers and a final dense layer.
