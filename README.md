# char-level-cnn
Character Level CNN using Tensorflow 1.15

Jupyter notebook for classifying text. Can be run on Google Colab using GPU runtime.

Can be trained classify any string of characters, e.g. human text or a DNA sequence. All it needs is a labeled training set.

Converts a text to a sequence of one-hot character encodings, and learns to predict text class using a sequence of convolutional layers and a final dense layer.
